This project uses machine learning techniques to detect diabetes based on patient health data. The dataset undergoes preprocessing and standardization, followed by training and testing with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The model achieves a strong accuracy score and provides a predictive system to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on input features.
